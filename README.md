A basic reverb from the daisy petal examples converted for the [terrarium](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/pcb351/) from [PedalPCB](https://www.pedalpcb.com).
If you only want to use the reverb simply download the binary `reverb.bin` [here](https://github.com/fxwiegand/terrarium-reverb/releases) and flash your daisy seed with the [web programmer](https://electro-smith.github.io/Programmer/).
